This project is made in entertainment purposes, as a joke to laugh at undercover "Hyperion" developer named BitDancer.
This story happened when SirHurt lead developer got a heads up on someone named "JustMagic" in Discord to access "Sirhurt files" from one person. We were laughing so hard that I made the copycat of "Epstein Files" themed as "US Department of Justice".
This website was vibecoded with Antigravity by Google, using Gemini 3.1 Pro, don't expect much from this project, just giggles and farts.
We will never know what did bitdancer meant by "sirhurt files", whether it is source code or something like that.
