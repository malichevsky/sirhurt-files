  <!-- To display a logo or banner, place an image in the images folder and uncomment the line below -->

This project is made in entertainment purposes, as a joke to laugh at undercover "Hyperion" developer named BitDancer.
This story happened when SirHurt lead developer got a heads up on someone named "JustMagic" in Discord to access "Sirhurt files" from one person. We were laughing so hard that I made the copycat of "Epstein Files" themed as "US Department of Justice".
This website was vibecoded with Antigravity by Google, using Gemini 3.1 Pro, don't expect much from this project, just giggles and farts.

## Adding Images to this README

To insert a GIF or PNG picture at the top of this README:

1. Place your image file (e.g., `logo.png` or `demo.gif`) into the `images` folder that is located in the same directory as this README.
2. Edit this `README.md` file and add the following Markdown syntax anywhere you'd like the image to appear:

   ```markdown
   ![Description of your image](images/send_me_the_sirhurt_files.gif)
   ```

3. If you want the image to be centered and resized, you can use HTML instead:

   ```html
   <div align="center">
     <img src="images/your-image-filename.png" alt="Description" width="500"/>
   </div>
   ```

*(There is already a commented-out HTML snippet at the very top of this file for convenience as an example!)*
